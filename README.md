Chrome extension to control YouTube playing in the background.  Use the media keys on your computer (F7 for previous song, F8 for play/pause, F9 for next song) to control playback from a different tab or even a different application.  Ctrl (Cmmd for mac) + Shift + 0 will shuffle and un-shuffle the playlist for you.

Known issues:
This extension does not yet support multiple YouTube watch page tabs open at once in any smart way.  Currently, it just picks the leftmost YouTube tab and controls that tab.
